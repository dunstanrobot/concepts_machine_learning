* Intermediate Python: Machine Learning is a followup course offered by fredhutch.io that will be pilot tested in November 2019. A similar course, Intermediate R: Machine Learning, is currently in development.
* The Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative, or the Coop, hosts many community meetings and office hours about data science. Learn more information about these groups [here](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/hosted-groups.html), 
* Join the [Coop Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWE5NGUyMTY1NGU0N2VmMmEyNTM5YzM1MmNlMTk2YmM1OWNkMmJiNTQxMTQ4OTNkMTFjMjk3M2Q0MzkwYzQ3NDA) to talk about data science with other Hutch researchers! 
* The [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org) is written by Hutch researchers and staff, and is a great place to find information about data management, bioinformatics, computing, and more.
